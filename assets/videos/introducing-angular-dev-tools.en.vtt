Hello, everyone.

00:01.500 --> 00:02.500
My name is Minko Gechev.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.700
I'm working on Angular at Google Today.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.500
In this video, I'll want to show you how you can use Angular

00:08.800 --> 00:12.000
DevTools to preview the structure of your application and

00:12.400 --> 00:13.500
profile its performance.

00:15.100 --> 00:18.200
Angular DevTools is the Chrome DevTools extension that you

00:18.300 --> 00:20.100
can download from the Chrome Webstar.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
You can find a link in the description below.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.300
When you install Angular DevTools, you can go to extensions and pin it.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.400
The next step is to open an application running in development

00:32.600 --> 00:37.100
mode. See how the color of the icon changed to red, indicating

00:37.900 --> 00:39.000
we can debug the application.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.000
Now let us open Chrome DevTools and find the Angular tab.

00:45.300 --> 00:45.300
Here.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.400
We can preview the componentry of the application.

00:49.100 --> 00:53.200
Once we select a component, we can find its metadata, properties,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.800
inputs, and outputs in the right panel, and we can modify

00:58.100 --> 00:59.800
them directly from the UI.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.300
Now let us navigate to the profiler tab and start recording

01:04.700 --> 01:05.500
change detection events.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.100
We can preview change detection cycles as they occur in real

01:09.300 --> 01:13.600
time. Each bar in the timeline corresponds to a separate

01:14.200 --> 01:15.100
change detection cycle.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.300
We can find how much time we spend in change detection and

01:19.600 --> 01:22.200
whether the current cycle costs any frame drops.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.700
We can also preview the estimated frame rates and what triggered

01:27.400 --> 01:28.000
change detection.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.200
At the bottom, we can preview the components we spent the

01:32.400 --> 01:32.900
most time in.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.800
When we select a bar, we can see further details for the

01:37.900 --> 01:38.700
particular component.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.500
To better understand the applications execution, we can switch

01:43.700 --> 01:46.800
between the default bar chart view or the two alternative

01:47.100 --> 01:50.000
views Flame graph and Tree map.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.600
That is all I have for you today.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.900
Head to Anguorio DevTools to find more advanced Angular DevTools

01:58.000 --> 02:01.300
features. Thank you very much for watching and happy coding.
